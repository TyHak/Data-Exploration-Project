# Data-Exploration-Project

- Work in a team, using R flex dashboard & Tableau to develop a data dashboard that effectively tells the story called "U.S. Minimum Wage by State from 1968 to 2020‚Äù.
- Make calculations and graphs which show an interesting story of the relationship between inflation and Wage Growth.
-  We clean the data by looking for missing data as well as any discrepancies in our data set. Through our rigorous checks and scanning, we did not find any discrepancies and proceeded with our data.
